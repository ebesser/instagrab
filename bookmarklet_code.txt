Note: var user_id needs to be the current user's id, meaning when asking the user to copy this code into a bookmark, the system must provide the user with his or her id

javascript:var url = document.URL; var user_id = 61;   
  $.ajax({     
    url: 'http://fast-bastion-5258.herokuapp.com/api_test',     
    dataType: 'json',     
    method: 'get',     
    data: { content: {user_id: user_id, url: url} },     
    success: function(){       
      console.log('snatched')     
    }   
  });
